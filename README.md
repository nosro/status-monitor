# Status Monitor

This is an exercise of React async behavior with a small nodeJS server.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is intended for local development only.

Here is what you need to know to run it:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Runs the server on port 4000, which is linked to the react app by means of the Create React App proxy.
